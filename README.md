# Welcome to the Harvard Game!

This game was developed for GENED 1091, Fall 2024, and simulates a year in the life of a Harvard student. The decisions they make factor into their school, fun, and rest scores as well as a score for five Chinese philosophers: Mengzi, Xunzi, Zhuangzi, Shang Yang, and Laozi.

The game was developed in Python with the `pygame` library and compiled for web with `pygbag`. Running the game locally requires both of these libraries to be installed.

To run the game locally, run `python main.py`.

To build the game for web, run `pygbag --app_name "The Harvard Game" --title "The Harvard Game" --icon [game-directory]/icon.png [game-directory]` from the parent directory.
